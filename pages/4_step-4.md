The Human Resources (HR) department is usually the primary source of personal data for federal employees and support staff within many agencies. HR is usually the first group within an agency to receive an individual’s identity information, often through the job application and employee on-boarding processes. By targeting integration and streamlining of these HR processes, you can see significant benefits to user life cycle management.


## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Streamline data exchange.** Integrate agency recruiting systems with government-wide applications to enable pre-population of on-boarding data provided by the applicant during the recruiting process.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Digitize the on-boarding process.** Allow employees to complete and track the progress of HR on-boarding forms online.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Integrate various HR systems.** Systems used by your agency’s HR department and the bureau/component level may operate separately to perform the same business processes, such as recruiting and on-boarding. These systems should be consolidated to eliminate redundant data collection and management.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Use digital signatures.** The use of digital signatures may allow your agency to more easily detect forgery or tampering by verifying that a form was created by a known person.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Establish an employee self-service portal.** Set up an online capability that allows employees to securely update their data, such as address, emergency contacts, and direct deposit account information. These data changes would ideally be populated downstream to reliant systems.
